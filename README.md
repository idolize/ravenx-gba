Raven X - Homebrew GBA Shooter
=============================

Raven X is a homebrew sidescrolling shooter game written entirely in C for the Gameboy Advance handheld gaming system with no additional libraries. I wrote this game for fun to become better with programming on devices. The [TONC](http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm) manual was used as a reference for interfacing with the GBA hardware.

Download the ROM (.gba file) and play it in your favorite Gameboy Advance emulator. I recommend [Visual Boy Advance](http://vba.ngemu.com/).

You can install the HAM 2.8 GBA deveopment toolchain in order to build the ROM, although other GBA toolchains can be used as well.
